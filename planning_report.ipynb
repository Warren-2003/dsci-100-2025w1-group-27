    "# Part 2: Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Broad Question\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Specific Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Question:** Can a player's **age** be used to predict the **total amount of time** a player spends on the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Addressing the Question with Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **`players.csv`** dataset to answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **explanatory variable** will be `age`, a numeric variable from `players.csv`.\n",
    "* The **response variable** will be `played_hours`, a numeric variable from `players.csv` that represents the total time a player has spent in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Data Wrangling Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data for analysis, we will use the `players.csv` data. The `sessions.csv` data is not required for this specific question, as `played_hours` is already a pre-aggregated total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimal wrangling steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Select Variables:** We will select the `age` and `played_hours` columns from the `players.csv` data.\n",
    "2.  **Handle Missing Values:** The `age` variable has two `NA` (missing) values. Since our explanatory variable cannot be missing, we will remove these two rows from the dataset for this analysis.\n",
    "3.  As noted in Part 1, `played_hours` is highly right-skewed. Our exploratory data analysis will investigate this skew (e.g., with a histogram) to determine if a transformation is necessary for modeling."
