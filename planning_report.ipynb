    "The players dataset includes 196 rows, each row representing a unique player. For each player, data on their experience, whether they are subscribed, their hashed email, playtime (hrs), name, gender, and age are included, making up a total of 7 columns. Out of these columns, playtime(hrs) and age are numeric variables, whereas all others are categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sessions dataset includes 1535 rows, all of which are individual sessions from different players; if a player plays from 3 - 4 and 5- 6, one row is logged as 3 - 4 and another for 5-6, for example. The columns include the hashed email of the player, the human-readable start and end times, as well as machine-readable start and end times (epoch). The hashed email column is categorical, and all of them are players from the player dataset. The machine-readable start and end times are numeric variables. The human-readable start and end times would be closer to a numeric variable than a categorical variable as they are merely converted directly from machine-readable start and end times, even though they are not strictly numeric by definition.\n",
