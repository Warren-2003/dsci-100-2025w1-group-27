This is an appropriate response variable because players who spend more time on the server produce more in-game logs, interactions, and behavioral data—making them more valuable for the research project.\n",

    "1. `experience`: captures the player's skill or familiarity with the game.\n",
    "2. `gender`: allows us to explore potential behavioral differences between male and female players.\n",
